# Data Analyst Resume Points - Customer Churn Analysis Project

Enhanced Customer Churn Analysis with ML, CLV and Explainability                                                            [Date Range or Location]

Developed end-to-end machine learning pipeline using Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM) for customer churn prediction, integrating exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation, and comprehensive model evaluation metrics (ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, Brier Score), implementing probability calibration and cost-sensitive threshold optimization to maximize retention ROI.

Built interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time customer analytics featuring risk scoring, K-means customer segmentation, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction using Beta-Geometric/NBD and Gamma-Gamma statistical models, lift charts, gains analysis, and ROI calculations, enabling data-driven retention campaign targeting and batch customer scoring with CSV export capabilities.

Implemented advanced model explainability and segmentation analytics using SHAP and LIME for global and local feature importance analysis, performed unsupervised clustering with optimal cluster selection metrics (silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz), calculated predictive CLV with confidence intervals, and delivered actionable insights through segment profiling, statistical analysis, and data quality reporting to support strategic customer retention decisions.
